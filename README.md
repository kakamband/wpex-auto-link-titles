WP Auto Post Link Title Attributes Free WordPress Plugin

*IMPORTANT*: This plugin was created a while back. It is no longer important to have title attributes on your links as long as the link itself has text.
This plugin was intended for SEO reasons but is no longer needed and I would actually recommend against using it for accessibility reasons.
